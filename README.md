# Cloud Governance Gone Rogue â€“ Azure Policy Lab

## Summary
This lab involved implementing cloud governance using Azure Policy to enforce secure and compliant deployment practices. I created and assigned custom policies to deny resources that violate company standards.

## Policy Definitions
- **Only-CanadaCentral**: Denies any resource deployed outside the Canada Central region.
- **Require-ProjectName-Tag**: Requires all resources to have a `ProjectName` tag.
- **Deny-Public-IP**: Prevents creation of public IP addresses.
